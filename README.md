# Angular single-page application that authenticates users against Azure AD and calls a protected ASP.NET Core web API

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of Angular 11 and MSAL Angular v2.

Check it out:

- [Angular SPA using MSAL Angular to sign-in users with Azure AD and call .NET Core web API](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-tutorial/blob/main/3-Authorization-II/1-call-api/README.md)
- [Deploy your Angular application to Azure Cloud](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-tutorial/blob/main/4-Deployment/README.md)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the [master branch](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-spa-aspnetcore-webapi/tree/master), but please know that it's no longer maintained.
