# A Angular single-page application that authenticates users with Azure AD and calls a protected ASP.NET Core web API

![Build badge](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/a7934fdd-dcde-4492-a406-7fad6ac00e17/<BuildNumber>/badge)

## About this sample

### Overview

This sample demonstrates a TodoListSPA application calling a TodoListAPI that is secured using Azure Active Directory.

1. The .Net client TodoListSPA application uses the MicroSoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to obtain a JWT access token from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authenticate the user when calling the TodoListAPI.

> Insert a screen copy of the client

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload)
- An Internet connection
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-spa-aspnetcore-webapi.git
```
or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> Given that the name of the sample is quiet long, and so are the names of the referenced NuGet packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

### Step 2:  Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- either follow the steps [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant](#choose-the-azure-ad-tenant-where-you-want-to-create-your-applications)
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you. Note that this works for Visual Studio only.
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

1. On Windows, run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   .\AppCreationScripts\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

1. Open the Visual Studio solution and click start to run the code.

</details>

Follow the steps below to manually walk through the steps to register and configure the applications.
#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory**.
   Change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the service app (TodoListAPI)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Click **New registration** on top.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `TodoListAPI`.
   - Change **Supported account types** to **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**.
1. Click on the **Register** button in bottom to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for use later. You'll need it to configure the configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Click the **Save** button on top to save the changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an Api for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Click `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI thats unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (api://{clientId}) by selecting **Save**.
1. All Apis have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
          - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
          - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**
          - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access TodoListAPI`
          - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access TodoListAPI as the signed-in user.`
          - For **User consent display name** type `Access TodoListAPI`
          - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access TodoListAPI on your behalf.`
          - Keep **State** as **Enabled**
          - Click on the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.

##### Configure the  service app (TodoListAPI) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio) to configure the code.
>In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `TodoListApplication\TodoListAPI\appsettings.json` file
1. Find the app key `Instance` and replace the existing value with https://login.microsoftonline.com/.
1. Find the app key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the app key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `TodoListAPI` application copied from the Azure portal.

#### Register the client app (TodoListSPA)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Click **New registration** on top.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `TodoListSPA`.
   - Change **Supported account types** to **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**.
   - In the Redirect URI (optional) section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URIs: `http://localhost:4200`.
1. Click on the **Register** button in bottom to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for use later. You'll need it to configure the configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Authentication** blade in the left.
   - In the **Advanced settings** section, set **Logout URL** to `http://localhost:4200`.
   - In the **Advanced settings** | **Implicit grant** section, check the **Access tokens** and **ID tokens** option as this sample requires
     the [Implicit grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow) to be enabled to
     sign-in the user, and call an API.

1. Click the **Save** button on top to save the changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the Apis that your application needs.
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the list of APIs, select the API `TodoListAPI`.
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **access_as_user** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Click on the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

##### Configure the  client app (TodoListSPA) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio) to configure the code.
>In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `TodoListApplication\TodoListAPI\src\app\app-config.ts` file
1. Find the app key `Authority` and replace the existing value with https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.
1. Find the app key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `TodoListSPA` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `ReturnUri` and replace the existing value with the base address of the TodoListSPA project (by default `http://localhost:4200`).
1. Find the app key `webApi` and replace the existing value with the base address of the TodoListAPI project (by default `https://localhost:44351/api/todolist`).
1. Find the app key `scopes` and replace the existing value with Scope.

## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This project has two WebApp / Web API projects. To deploy them to Azure Web Sites, you'll need, for each one, to:

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

### Create and publish the `TodoListAPI` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner, select **Web** --> **Web App**, and give your web site a name, for example, `TodoListAPI-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Thereafter select the `Subscription`, `Resource Group`, `App service plan and Location`. `OS` will be **Windows** and `Publish` will be **Code**.
1. Click `Create` and wait for the App Service to be created.
1. Once you get the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created App service.

## Review and delete the following two lines if not applicable ##
1. The following steps provide instructions to create a Sql database that the sample needs. If you already have a Sql Server and database present and a connection string available, skip the steps till we ask you to provide the connections string in the `Application Settings`.
1. Click `Create a resource` in the top left-hand corner again, select **Databases** --> **SQL Database**, to create a new database. Follow the `Quickstart tutorial` if needed.
1. You can name the Sql server and database whatever you want to.
1. Select or create a database server, and enter server login credentials. Carefully note down the username and password for the Sql server as you'll need it when constructing your Sql conenction string later.
1. Wait for the `Deployment succeeded` notification, then click on `Go to resource` to navigate to the newly created database's manage screen.
1. Click on **Connection Strings** on left menu and copy the **ADO.NET (SQL authentication)** connection string. Populate  **User ID={your_username};Password={your_password};** with values your provided during database creation.Copy this connection string.
## Review and delete the following two lines if not applicable end ##

1. Once the web site is created, locate it it in the **Dashboard** and click it to open **App Services** **Overview** screen.

## Review and delete the following two lines if not applicable ##
1. Click on **Application settings** in the left menu of the App service and add the copied Sql connection string in the **Connection strings** section as `DefaultConnection`.
1. Choose `SQLAzure` in the **Type** dropdown. **Save** the setting.
## Review and delete the following two lines if not applicable end ##

1. From the **Overview** tab of the App Service, download the publish profile by clicking the **Get publish profile** link and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.
1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the TodoListAPI project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
1. Click on **Configure** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is a `https` in the home page url, for example [https://TodoListAPI-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListAPI-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click **Next**.
1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Active Directory tenant application registration for `TodoListAPI`

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.
1. In the resultant screen, select the `TodoListAPI` application.
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://TodoListAPI-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListAPI-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect urls, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's Uri for each redirect url.

### Update the `TodoListSPA` to call the `TodoListAPI` Running in Azure Web Sites

1. In Visual Studio, go to the `TodoListSPA` project.
2. Open `TodoListApplication\TodoListAPI\src\app\app-config.ts`.  Only one change is needed - update the `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` key value to be the address of the website you published,
   for example, [https://TodoListAPI-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListAPI-contoso.azurewebsites.net).
3. Run the client! If you are trying multiple different client types (for example, .Net, Windows Store, Android, iOS) you can have them all call this one published web API.
